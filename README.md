## WHO'S THIS WEBSITE FOR? <a name="whos-this-website-for-heading"></a>
This is a website for people who simply love baking, or even just beginning to be interested in baking. People who would like to look at someone‚Äôs recipes for new ideas and / or who would like to share their own recipes with other people. 
The website is designed to be obvious its purpose for first-time users. Everything is laid out simply and navigated quite easily so users can adapt the website fairly quickly, and that makes users keep coming back to the website. All the recipes are visible to any users so they do not need to create an account if they just would like to look at recipes. If users would like to post their recipes, then they need to create an account but the process of creating an account is very simple without any hassles. Some users may want to buy new tools for baking so there is a "shop" page that uses can look at and purchase goods.

## WHO IS THE OWNER? <a name="who-is-the-owner-heading"></a>
I am the owner of the website. The primary goal of the website is to provide a platform that users can look at baking recipes and / or share their recipes without any hassles. 
There is a ‚Äúshop‚Äù page that some tools relate to baking are listed &#40;affiliate&#41; so in case users find something interesting or useful, they can purchase it from the website, and I can get a commission from the sellers. I would like to collect their e-mail address for newsletters to expand the community.

## UX 5 PLANES <a name="ux5-planes-heading"></a>

### Strategy Plane <a name="strategy-plane-heading"></a>

The website is designed for those who love baking, and who are interested in baking. People who have been baking might want to share their knowledge with other people as it gives them great feeling and motivation, so by following very simple registration steps, they can create an account and post their recipes in a well-structured format. People who have less experience in baking and would just like to see recipes, they can do it simply by visiting the website, where all the recipes are shown by posted date, or they can see them by category &#40;bread, cake, biscuit&#41; on different pages. There is a search field on the website so they can search for specific recipes by keywords. To see recipes, users do not need to register so it is hassle-free. There is a ‚Äúshop‚Äù page that has a number of baking items in an affiliate style so in case users would like to purchase something, they can do it by clicking the link and it leads users to the website of the sellers.¬†The design of the website is meaningful and simple so that the purpose of the website is very clear for first-time users, and they can easily adapt to the website. Owner‚Äôs main goal is to provide a community platform that is easy to use whether they are first-time or returning users, and this is the key to grow the community. To achieve this, all the contents and functions are laid out as the user‚Äôs first concept.

All the functions on the tables below are minimum requirements on the website to achieve the current user's and owner's goals. &#40;On a scale of 1 &#91;least&#93; - 5 &#91;most&#93;&#41;

Below are the additional functions that can improve the website, however, these are not mandatory to achieve the current user's and owner's goals. Some are not implemented due to a lack of my current skills & knowledge and some due to a lack of time.

### Structure Plane <a name="scope-plane-heading"></a>

‚ÄîFront-end‚Äî<br>
The website consists of a **Home** page with **10 other core pages**.
*   **Home** &#40;`index.html`&#41;<br>This is the main page of the website. There is a log, navigation bar to *Categories* &#40;`categories_bred | cake | biscuit.html`&#41;, *Shop* &#40;`shop.html`&#41;, *Register* &#40;`register.html`&#41; and *Login* &#40;`login.html`&#41; pages, a hero image and all the recipes are contained. There is a footer with some social icons and a form to subscribe to newsletters
*   **Categories** &#40;`categories_bred | cake | biscuit.html`&#41;<br>These are the pages where users can see recipes by category. The same header and footer are used as *Home*
*   **Shop** &#40;`shop.html`&#41;<br>This is the page where users can see some baking items. The same header and footer are used as *Home*
*   **Register** &#40;`register.html`&#41;<br>This is the page where users can create an account. Once users create an account successfully, they will be led to a *Profile* &#40;`profile.html`&#41; page. The same header and footer are used as *Home* but there are additional navigation links to *Create Recipe* &#40;`create_recipe.html`&#41;, *Edit Recipe* &#40;`edit_recipe.html`&#41; and *Logout*. For an <ins>admin</ins> user, there is a page to *Edit Category* &#40;`edit_category.html`&#41;
*   **Login** &#40;`login.html`&#41;<br>This is the page where users with account can log in the website. Once users log in successfully, they will be led to the **Profile** &#40;`profile.html`&#41; page. The same header and footer are used as *Home* but there are additional navigation links to *Create Recipe* &#40;`create_recipe.html`&#41;, *Edit Recipe* &#40;`edit_recipe.html`&#41; and *Logout*. For an <ins>admin</ins> user, there is a page to *Edit Category* &#40;`edit_category.html`&#41;<br>
Any users have access to a full recipe by clicking a link and it is also open on a unique link.<br>
Below is the chart of the website to show the core relationships between the pages. &#40;All the pages are linked to each other subject to permission&#41;<br>

‚ÄîBack-end‚Äî<br>
Users must have an account to post a recipe so there is a *users collection* that is linked with the *user of baking recipes collection*. Same principle as a *users collection* that users can only post recipes for the categories in a *categories collection* so it is also liked with the *category of baking recipes collection*. Categories in *categories collection* are editable by admin so it is created as an independent collection. Data in *subscription collection* is independent data for newsletters because users who do not have an account can also subscribe to it if they wish to do.<br>
Below is the chart of the database to show the collections and their relationships.<br>

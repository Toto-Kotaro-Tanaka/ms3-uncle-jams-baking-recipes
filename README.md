## WHO'S THIS WEBSITE FOR? <a name="whos-this-website-for-heading"></a>
This is a website for people who simply love baking, or even just beginning to be interested in baking. People who would like to look at someone‚Äôs recipes for new ideas and / or who would like to share their own recipes with other people. 
The website is designed to be obvious its purpose for first-time users. Everything is laid out simply and navigated quite easily so users can adapt the website fairly quickly, and that makes users keep coming back to the website. All the recipes are visible to any users so they do not need to create an account if they just would like to look at recipes. If users would like to post their recipes, then they need to create an account but the process of creating an account is very simple without any hassles. Some users may want to buy new tools for baking so there is a "shop" page that uses can look at and purchase goods.

## WHO IS THE OWNER? <a name="who-is-the-owner-heading"></a>
I am the owner of the website. The primary goal of the website is to provide a platform that users can look at baking recipes and / or share their recipes without any hassles. 
There is a ‚Äúshop‚Äù page that some tools relate to baking are listed (affiliate) so in case users find something interesting or useful, they can purchase it from the website, and I can get a commission from the sellers. I would like to collect their e-mail address for mail magazines or something similar to expand the community.

## WHO'S THIS WEBSITE FOR? <a name="whos-this-website-for-heading"></a>
This is a website for people who simply love baking, or even just beginning to be interested in baking. People who would like to look at someone‚Äôs recipes for new ideas and / or who would like to share their own recipes with other people can do both on this website. The website is designed to be obvious its purpose for first-time users. Everything is laid out simply and navigated quite easily so users can adapt to the website fairly quickly, and that makes users keep coming back to the website. All the recipes are visible to any users so they do not need to create an account if they just would like to see recipes. If users would like to post their recipes, then they need to create an account but the process of creating an account is very simple. Some users may want to buy new baking items so there is a *Shop* page that uses can look at some items and purchase them on the seller's website.

<div align="right"><a href="#table-of-contents">üîù</a></div>

## WHO IS THE OWNER? <a name="who-is-the-owner-heading"></a>
I am the owner of the website. The primary goal of the website is to provide a platform that users can look at baking recipes and / or share their recipes without any hassles. There is a *Shop* page that some baking items are listed &#40;affiliate&#41; so in case users find something interesting, they can access to the seller's website for more details of the items and can also purchase them. I can get a commission from the seller for any items being sold through my website and this is also one of the goals. I would like to collect their e-mail address for newsletters to expand the community.

## UX 5 PLANES <a name="ux5-planes-heading"></a>

### Strategy Plane <a name="strategy-plane-heading"></a>

The website is designed for those who love baking, and who are interested in baking. People who have been baking might want to share their knowledge with other people as it gives them great feeling and motivation, so by following very simple registration steps, they can create an account and post their recipes in a well-structured format. People who have less experience in baking and would just like to see recipes, they can do it simply by visiting the website, where all the recipes are shown by posted date, or they can see them by category &#40;bread, cake, biscuit&#41; on different pages. There is a search field on the website so they can search for specific recipes by keywords. To see recipes, users do not need to register so it is hassle-free. There is a *shop* page that has a number of baking items in an affiliate style so in case users would like to purchase something, they can do it by clicking the link and it leads users to the website of the sellers.¬†The design of the website is meaningful and simple so that the purpose of the website is very clear for first-time users, and they can easily adapt to the website. Owner‚Äôs main goal is to provide a community platform that is easy to use whether they are first-time or returning users, and this is the key to grow the community. To achieve this, all the contents and functions are laid out as the user‚Äôs first concept.

All the functions on the tables below are minimum requirements on the website to achieve the current user's and owner's goals. &#40;On a scale of 1 &#91;least&#93; - 5 &#91;most&#93;&#41;

Below are the additional functions that can improve the website, however, these are not mandatory to achieve the current user's and owner's goals. Some are not implemented due to a lack of my current skills & knowledge and some due to a lack of time.

‚Äî Back-end ‚Äî<br>
Users must have an account to post recipes so there is a *users collection* that have *username* and *password* as keys of the data. *username* in *users collections* is linked with the *username* in *recipes collection* because users who have an account can only create a recipe and they create a recipe in their own account. Same principle as *username* in *users collection* that users can only create a recipe for the categories available in a *categories collection* so it is liked with *category_name* in *recipes collection*. Categories in *categories collection* are editable by admin so it is created as an independent collection. Data in *subscription collection* is independent data for newsletters because users who do not have an account can also subscribe to it if they wish to do. The data in all the collections are retrievable and they can be identified by the key or unique id of the object. <br>

### Skeleton Plane <a name="skeleton-plane-heading"></a>
It is a mobile-first website because people usually do baking with a recipe so a good mobile-first design helps users whose purpose is to see recipes. There are wireframes of mobile and desktop sizes for all the core pages of the website.

### Surface Plane <a name="surface-plane-heading"></a>
‚Äî Colour ‚Äî<br>
As this website is for baking, light brownish colour is used as the main colour. Currently, the background image for the main section is decided, which is a brick style wallpaper with Tumbleweed (#eaac7f).
Other colours such as background, fonts etc are not decided yet. They will be light brown, light pink or light grey colours but the exact colours will be decided as the website is being built.

‚Äî Typography ‚Äî<br>
Amatic SC is used for the main heading ‚ÄúUncle Jam‚Äôs Baking Recipes‚Äù because this handwritten type of font links with recipes (hand made) very well.

![image](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms3-uncle-jams-baking-recipes/blob/master/assets/readme/ux/amatic-sc.png)<br>

Balsamiq Sans, which is also another type of handwritten font, is used for menu and other headings &#40;h2 - h6&#41; as it matches the image of the website well.

![image](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms3-uncle-jams-baking-recipes/blob/master/assets/readme/ux/balsamiq-sans.png)<br>

Nunito, which is Sans Serif type font, is used for texts on the body to give users maximum readability.
